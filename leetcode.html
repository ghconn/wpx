        Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number
        is the smallest possible.
        <p></p>
        Note:
        The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.
        The given num does not contain any leading zero.
        <p></p>
        Example 1:
        Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
        Output: "1219"
        Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
        <p></p>
        Example 2:
        Input: num = "10200", k = 1
        Output: "200"
        Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
        <p></p>
        Example 3:
        Input: num = "10", k = 2
        Output: "0"
        Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
